**What it does**

GPASS (Genome-wide Poisson Approximation for Statistical Significance)
detects significant single-SNP associations in case-control studies at a user-specified FDR.  Unlike previous methods, this tool can accurately approximate the genome-wide significance and FDR of SNP associations, while adjusting for millions of multiple comparisons, within seconds or minutes.

The program has two main functionalities:

1. Detect significant single-SNP associations at a user-specified false
   discovery rate (FDR).

   *Note*: a "typical" definition of FDR could be
            FDR = E(# of false positive SNPs / # of significant SNPs)

   This definition however is very inappropriate for association mapping, since SNPs are
   highly correlated.  Our FDR is
   defined differently to account for SNP correlations, and thus will obtain
   a proper FDR in terms of "proportion of false positive loci".

2. Approximate the significance of a list of candidate SNPs, adjusting for
   multiple comparisons. If you have isolated a few SNPs of interest and want 
   to know their significance in a GWAS, you can supply the GWAS data and let 
   the program specifically test those SNPs.


*Also note*: the number of SNPs in a study cannot be both too small and at the same
time too clustered in a local region. A few hundreds of SNPs, or tens of SNPs
spread in different regions, will be fine. The sample size cannot be too small
either; around 100 or more individuals (case + control combined) will be fine.
Otherwise use permutation.
