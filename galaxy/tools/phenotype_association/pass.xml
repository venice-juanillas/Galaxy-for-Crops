**What it does**

PASS (Poisson Approximation for Statistical Significance) detects
significant transcription factor binding sites in the genome from
ChIP data.  This is probably the only peak-calling method that
accurately controls the false-positive rate and FDR in ChIP data,
which is important given the huge discrepancy in results obtained
from different peak-calling algorithms.  At the same time, this
method achieves a similar or better power than previous methods.

<!-- we don't have wrapper support for the "prior" file yet
Another unique feature of this method is that it allows varying
thresholds to be used for peak calling at different genomic
locations.  For example, if a position lies in an open chromatin
region, is depleted of nucleosome positioning, or a co-binding
protein has been detected within the neighborhood, then the position
is more likely to be bound by the target protein of interest, and
hence a lower threshold will be used to call significant peaks.
As a result, weak but real binding sites can be detected.

**Hints**

- ChIP-Seq data:

  If the data is from ChIP-Seq, you need to convert the ChIP-Seq values
  into z-scores before using this program.  It is also recommended that
  you group read counts within a neighborhood together, e.g. in tiled
  windows of 30bp.  In this way, the ChIP-Seq data will resemble
  ChIP-chip data in format.

- Choosing window size options:

  The window size is related to the probe tiling density.  For example,
  if the probes are tiled at every 100bp, then setting the smallest
  window = 2 and largest window = 6 is appropriate, because the DNA
  fragment size is around 300-500bp.

    etc.

  In GFF, a value of dot '.' is used to mean "not applicable".
