class SNPData:
    '''
    This class provides a datastructure for SNP datasets being imputed with NPUTE. Input
    files should be either CSV or TXT files with lines as SNPs (separated by crlf) and
    columns as samples.  The alleles in the SNPs may be separated by commas or nothing.
    The SNPs must be in order by chromosome position.  The SNPs must be ternary with
    a majority allele, a minority allele (not required), and a unknowns (not required).
    Majoriy and minority alleles can be represented by any characters, but an unknown
    must be a '?' character.
